# nvimSetup

My personal nvim setup. For now it has parenthesis/brackets/etc matching, 4 space tabs, git integration, prolog syntax highlighting, and the pathogen plugin manager included.

Small disclaimer: I do not claim to own/have developed any of the features in my files. If you coded anything in this repo, you are awesome and you have my deepest gratitude! :D
